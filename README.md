# Project Dark
## Description

The intent of this project is to learn NestJS and create something with it. The scope of the project is in flux but at the time of writing this I want to use websockets to create kind of a simple virtual tabletop. This might be repurposed in the future.

## Some mental notes

### Single Repo
I'm using a single repo here because I'm the only one working on it and I don't mind coupling the front-end and backend but if this would be bigger I'd totally have the front and the back in seperate repos. This way you can have different teams working on different parts of the project and you can have different release cycles for the front and the back.
